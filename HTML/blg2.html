        <p>For over a long period, some of the most intelligent minds have worked to advance printing technology. The printer you have in your home or office is the result of some incredible breakthroughs and expert engineering.<br></p>

        <h3>Early Printing and the printing Press</h3>
        <P>Before Johannes Gutenberg introduced the printing press in the 1440s, there were two options to reproduce literature or images:<br><br><b>Hire a Scribe -</b> this expensive and time-consuming process involved a scribe reproducing and illustrating an entire book or document by hand.<br><br> <b>Block Printing -</b> This type of printing involved carving letters and images into the face of a block of wood, covering it with ink, and pressing it onto a medium such as paper.<br><br></P>
        <img src="../images/e.jpg" style="width: 50%; height: 500px; left: 50%;" alt="">
        <p>For nearly 500 years, the basics of printing technology remained the same. While the equipment became more efficient and durable, the printing press was just that, a printing press.</p>

        <h3>The Xerograph, Xerography, and Xerox</h3>
        <p>Printer evolution finally took its next step towards modern times. It was on October 22, 1938, when the first xerograph image was made. It was Chester Carlson who developed this printing method and called it xerography.<br><br>

            Xerography uses dry ink (toner) which by an electrically charged photoconductor-coated metal plate and flashes of light cause the dry ink to stick to a drum. The drum then rolls over the paper, leaving the ink and copied image behind. <br><br></p>
            <img src="../images/f.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
            <p>The name was inspired by the Greek language dry (xero) plus writing (graph). The process was refined over the next 20 years before going to market, and the company he worked for at the time eventually changed its name to Xerox Corporation in 1961.</p>

            <h3>The laser Printer</h3>
            <p>As incredible as it may seem, laser printer technology preceded inkjet technology in the consumer market. While working at a Xerox research center in the late 1960s, Gary Starkweather combined laser technology with a xerographic copier.</p><br><br>
            <img src="../images/g.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
            <p>By 1981, Xerox released an office version of the laser printer known as the Xerox 9700 Laser Printer. However, it was Canon partnered with Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard in 1984 that released the HP LaserJet, a consumer version of the laser printer.</p>

            <h3>The 3-D Printer</h3>
            <p>It was in 1984 that Charles Hull invented the 3D printer. This technology used a vat photopolymerization technique called stereolithography.<br>

                Known today in general terms as additive manufacturing, much of the attention it gets is due to a lack of waste in the production process. 3D printing produces what will be utilized without the need to remove excess material, thus reducing discarded material and the energy needed to produce the product.<br>
                
                The most popular form of 3D printing is that which adds layers of a selected material one on top of the other to create a three-dimensional figure. As time has passed, the applications of 3D printing have expanded to the medical field, construction, aviation, and even the food industry.</p><br><br>

                <h3>The All in One Printer</h3>
                <p>In the early â€˜90s, printers evolved once more. The all in one printer that includes copying, scanning, printing, and fax capabilities came to the market to eliminate the need for a separate machine for each feature.</p><br><br>

                <h3>The Wireless Printers</h3>
                <p>In 1993, Andrew Clams invented the wireless printer. This printer connects to your device by Bluetooth or via Wi-Fi, permitting you to roam freely with your device and allows several wireless devices to print at the same time.</p><br><br>
                <img src="../images/j.jpg" alt="">
                <p>A significant portion of the printer market now belongs to wireless printers. By 2010 alone, half of all printers sold in the US were wireless.</p>
